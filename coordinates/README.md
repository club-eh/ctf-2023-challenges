### Challenge Question

We discovered a t3l0s hideout but they are gone, along with their data. They must have left in a rush because we were able to recover this file. What can you tell us about it?

  <summary>Answer Summary</summary>
  This is a GCODE file commonly used in CNC applications. This is one is specifically a sliced 3D print model.<br><br>
  Add the `.gcode` extension to the file and use an [online GCODE visualizer](https://cnc.im/homeworks/dxf-3dprinter/index.html) to see the flag. `3D mode` in the tool is easier to see.
