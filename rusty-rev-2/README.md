# Rusty Rev 2

<i>Hard Reverse Engineering Challenge by sudoBash418</i>

### Challenge Question

Looks like they've gotten smarter: this time the flag is locked behind a hash function!  
You might need the dark art of optimization for this one.

I'm sure you'll figure it out.  
Can't promise you won't be cursed in the process though :P

  <summary>Hints</summary>
  <ol>
   <li>This challenge can be solved similarly to Rusty Rev 1 - but you'll want to optimize your script.</li>
   <li>Don't forget the flag format:</li>
   <ol>
     <li>starts with `clubeh{`</li>
     <li>ends with `}`</li>
     <li>contains only printable ASCII characters</li>
   </ol>
   <li>A well-optimized script should be able to get the flag in under 3 minutes. You may have better luck with the x86-64 binary compared to the arm64 one.</li>
  </ol>
