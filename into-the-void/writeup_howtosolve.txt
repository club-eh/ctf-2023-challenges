1. look up common image steganography techniques, i.e., check hacktricks.xyz
1a. note that the image is a PNG, some stego techniques are unique to PNG and some may not even work on other formats or others may not work on this format. 
1b. the bits in the image may be a hint about "Least Significant Bit" steganography.
2. Most Stego-LSB tools will work.
2a. the one I used was: https://pypi.org/project/stego-lsb/
3. run the stego-lsb tool on the image and it will spit out another image with the flag as a string of text.
