<i>Easy OSINT challenge by Artemis</i>

### Challenge Question

Wikipedia contains some interesting information about [Echidna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna_(mythology)) for us, including a list of her offspring.  
I swear when I last looked at this in July 2014, there was another monster on the list, but now it's missing. How strange.

The flag format for this challenge is `clubeh{...}`, replacing the `...` with the name of offspring in lowercase (no spaces).
