Wikipedia contains some interesting information about [Echidna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna_(mythology)) for us, including a list of her offspring.  
I swear when I last looked at this in July 2014, there was another monster on the list, but now it's missing. How strange.

The flag format for this challenge is: `clubeh{<name of offspring in lowercase, without spaces>}`
