### Challenge Question

We thought we found a flag... but it's hidden inside this executable!

Can you figure out its secret?

  <ol>
   <li>Static analysis is a good place to start. Ghidra should do the trick.</li>
   <li>Dynamic analysis can get you the flag too; try `gdb`.</li>
   <li>The `flag-checker-arm64` file is for ARM64 computers, such as newer Apple devices. Most players will want the `flag-checker` file, for x86-64 computers.</li>
