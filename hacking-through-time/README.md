  <summary>Hints</summary>
  1. Tracing library calls might help.<br>
  2. This ain't `exploit`: nothing's stopping you from hooking whatever you want.<br>
  3. The `hacking-through-time-arm64` file is for ARM64 computers, such as newer Apple devices. Most players will want the `hacking-through-time` file, for x86-64 computers.
