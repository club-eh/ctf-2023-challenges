# Blinkenlights-0

<i>Medium MISC (Hardware and Forensics) Challenge by Artemis</i>

### Challenge Question

We found some microcontrollers the hackers were using to send each other secret messages.  
I wonder what this one says?

Note: there are two versions of the exact same recording.  
One is in grayscale (`-gray`), the other in full RGB. 
**You only need one to solve the challenge.**
